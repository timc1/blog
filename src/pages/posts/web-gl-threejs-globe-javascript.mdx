I was inspired by

implementation showcasing their global clients, and web developer,
<a href="https://flamov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam</a>'s
help and original idea of converting 2d points into a 3d globe, with special
thanks to

a motion designer here in LA, for helping me plot the world map.
