  title="Clear Structure & Visual Cues"
  description="Pages are structured with accessibility and usability in mind. Without a illustrator at hand, we decided to create illustrations and animations in place of photos using plain HTML/CSS and a bit of javascript to move things along, just like on this page. This experience is performant, eye-catching, and provides a different experience than what we typically see. Click on each of the search bars above to see the page."
